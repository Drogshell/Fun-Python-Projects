# Simple TKinter Projects
## This will be a repository with a few projects that document my learning of TKinter and Python. These are relatively simple yet fun apps.
### More complex Python apps will get their own dedicated repositories.

### First I start off with a QR code generator app.
This app can dynamically create QR codes based on what is entered in the text field.

You can also save the QR code for later.

You can also switch between imperial and metric
