# Python Projects that range from beginner to intermediate
## This will be a repository of projects that document my learning of Python as well as Tkinter and any other python libraries. I'm starting off with relatively simple yet fun apps, then moving on too more complex ones.
### Very large and complex Python apps will get their own dedicated repositories.
